    \ end_time: datetime\n:param exit_code: The exit code of the program specified\
    \ on the subtask\n command line. This parameter is returned only if the subtask\
    \ is in the\n completed state. The exit code for a process reflects the specific\n\
    \ convention implemented by the application developer for that process. If\n you\
    \ use the exit code value to make decisions in your code, be sure that\n you know\
    \ the exit code convention used by the application process. Note\n that the exit\
    \ code may also be generated by the compute node operating\n system, such as when\
    \ a process is forcibly terminated.\n:type exit_code: int\n:param scheduling_error:\
