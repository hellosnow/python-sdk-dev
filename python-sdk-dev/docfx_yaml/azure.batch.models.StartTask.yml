  summary: "A task which is run when a compute node joins a pool in the Azure Batch\n\
    service, or when the compute node is rebooted or reimaged.\n\n:param command_line:\
    \ The command line of the start task. The command line\n does not run under a\
    \ shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell\n features such as environment\
    \ variable expansion. If you want to take\n advantage of such features, you should\
    \ invoke the shell in the command\n line, for example using \"cmd /c MyCommand\"\
    \ in Windows or \"/bin/sh -c\n MyCommand\" in Linux.\n:type command_line: str\n\
    :param resource_files: A list of files that the Batch service will\n download\
    \ to the compute node before running the command line.\n:type resource_files:\
    \ list of :class:`ResourceFile\n <azure.batch.models.ResourceFile>`\n:param environment_settings:\
    \ A list of environment variable settings for\n the start task.\n:type environment_settings:\
