  summary: "Contains information about the execution of a Job Release task on a\n\
    compute node.\n\n:param start_time: The time at which the task started running.\
    \ Note that\n every time the task is restarted, this value is updated.\n:type\
    \ start_time: datetime\n:param end_time: The time at which the Job Release task\
    \ completed. This\n property is set only if the task is in the Completed state.\n\
    :type end_time: datetime\n:param state: The current state of the Job Release task.\
    \ Possible values\n include: 'running', 'completed'\n:type state: str or :class:`JobReleaseTaskState\n\
    \ <azure.batch.models.JobReleaseTaskState>`\n:param task_root_directory: The root\
    \ directory of the Job Release task on\n the compute node. You can use this path\
    \ to retrieve files created by the\n task, such as log files.\n:type task_root_directory:\
    \ str\n:param task_root_directory_url: The URL to the root directory of the Job\n\
    \ Release task on the compute node.\n:type task_root_directory_url: str\n:param\
    \ exit_code: The exit code of the program specified on the task\n command line.\
    \ This parameter is returned only if the task is in the\n completed state. The\
    \ exit code for a process reflects the specific\n convention implemented by the\
    \ application developer for that process. If\n you use the exit code value to\
    \ make decisions in your code, be sure that\n you know the exit code convention\
    \ used by the application process. Note\n that the exit code may also be generated\
    \ by the compute node operating\n system, such as when a process is forcibly terminated.\n\
    :type exit_code: int\n:param scheduling_error: The scheduling error encountered\
    \ by the Batch\n service when starting the task.\n:type scheduling_error: :class:`TaskSchedulingError\n\
    \ <azure.batch.models.TaskSchedulingError>`"
