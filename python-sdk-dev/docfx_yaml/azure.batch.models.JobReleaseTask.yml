  summary: "A Job Release task to run on job completion on any compute node where\
    \ the\njob has run.\n\n:param id: A string that uniquely identifies the Job Release\
    \ task within\n the job. The id can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters\n\
    \ including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than 64\n characters.\n\
    :type id: str\n:param command_line: The command line of the Job Release task.\
    \ The\n command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take\n advantage\
    \ of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If\n you want to take\
    \ advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell\n in the command line,\
    \ for example using \"cmd /c MyCommand\" in Windows or\n \"/bin/sh -c MyCommand\"\
    \ in Linux.\n:type command_line: str\n:param resource_files: A list of files that\
    \ the Batch service will\n download to the compute node before running the command\
    \ line.\n:type resource_files: list of :class:`ResourceFile\n <azure.batch.models.ResourceFile>`\n\
    :param environment_settings: A list of environment variable settings for\n the\
    \ Job Release task.\n:type environment_settings: list of :class:`EnvironmentSetting\n\
    \ <azure.batch.models.EnvironmentSetting>`\n:param max_wall_clock_time: The maximum\
    \ elapsed time that the Job Release\n task may run on a given compute node, measured\
    \ from the time the task\n starts. If the task does not complete within the time\
    \ limit, the Batch\n service terminates it. The default value is 15 minutes.\n\
    :type max_wall_clock_time: timedelta\n:param retention_time: The minimum time\
    \ to retain the working directory\n for the Job Release task on the compute node.\
    \ After this time, the Batch\n service may delete the working directory and all\
    \ its contents.  The\n default is infinite.\n:type retention_time: timedelta\n\
    :param run_elevated: Whether to run the Job Release task in elevated\n mode. The\
    \ default value is false.\n:type run_elevated: bool"
