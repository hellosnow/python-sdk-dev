  summary: "Parameters for a CloudJobOperations.Patch request.\n\n:param priority:\
    \ The priority of the job. Priority values can range from\n -1000 to 1000, with\
    \ -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the\n highest priority. If omitted,\
    \ the priority of the job is left unchanged.\n:type priority: int\n:param on_all_tasks_complete:\
    \ Specifies an action the Batch service\n should take when all tasks in the job\
    \ are in the completed state.\n Possible values include: 'noAction', 'terminateJob'\n\

    \ when the job is disabled.\n The Patch Job call will fail if you include the\

    \ specification in the poolInfo, only the keepAlive property can be\n updated,\
    \ and then only if the auto pool has a poolLifetimeOption of job.\n If omitted,\
