  summary: "Load balancer Probe.\n\nVariables are only populated by the server, and\

    :vartype load_balancing_rules: list of :class:`SubResource\n <azure.mgmt.network.models.SubResource>`\n\
    :param protocol: Gets or sets the protocol of the end point. Possible\n values\
    \ are http or Tcp. If Tcp is specified, a received ACK is required\n for the probe\
    \ to be successful. If http is specified,a 200 OK response\n from the specifies\
    \ URI is required for the probe to be successful.\n Possible values include: 'Http',\
    \ 'Tcp'\n:type protocol: str or :class:`ProbeProtocol\n <azure.mgmt.network.models.ProbeProtocol>`\n\
    :param port: Gets or sets Port for communicating the probe. Possible\n values\
    \ range from 1 to 65535, inclusive.\n:type port: int\n:param interval_in_seconds:\
    \ Gets or sets the interval, in seconds, for\n how frequently to probe the endpoint\
    \ for health status. Typically, the\n interval is slightly less than half the\
    \ allocated timeout period (in\n seconds) which allows two full probes before\
    \ taking the instance out of\n rotation. The default value is 15, the minimum\
    \ value is 5\n:type interval_in_seconds: int\n:param number_of_probes: Gets or\
    \ sets the number of probes where if no\n response, will result in stopping further\
    \ traffic from being delivered\n to the endpoint. This values allows endpoints\
    \ to be taken out of\n rotation faster or slower than the typical times used in\
    \ Azure.\n:type number_of_probes: int\n:param request_path: Gets or sets the URI\
    \ used for requesting health\n status from the VM. Path is required if a protocol\
    \ is set to http.\n Otherwise, it is not allowed. There is no default value\n\
