  summary: "Information about a start task running on a compute node.\n\n:param state:\
    \ The state of the start task on the compute node. Possible\n values include:\
    \ 'running', 'completed'\n:type state: str or :class:`StartTaskState\n <azure.batch.models.StartTaskState>`\n\
    :param start_time: The time at which the start task started running.\n:type start_time:\
    \ datetime\n:param end_time: The time at which the start task stopped running.\n\
    :type end_time: datetime\n:param exit_code: The exit code of the program specified\
    \ on the task\n command line. This parameter is returned only if the task is in\
    \ the\n completed state. The exit code for a process reflects the specific\n convention\
    \ implemented by the application developer for that process. If\n you use the\
    \ exit code value to make decisions in your code, be sure that\n you know the\
    \ exit code convention used by the application process. Note\n that the exit code\
    \ may also be generated by the compute node operating\n system, such as when a\
    \ process is forcibly terminated.\n:type exit_code: int\n:param scheduling_error:\
    \ Any error encountered scheduling the start task.\n:type scheduling_error: :class:`TaskSchedulingError\n\
    \ <azure.batch.models.TaskSchedulingError>`\n:param retry_count: The number of\
    \ times the task has been retried by the\n Batch service.\n:type retry_count:\
    \ int\n:param last_retry_time: The most recent time at which a retry of the task\n\
    \ started running.\n:type last_retry_time: datetime"
